This project focuses on classifying images of 10 popular food categories using a dataset containing 10,000 images. The dataset features diverse food types, including apple pie, chicken wings, dumplings, and more.

## Technical Approach

- **CNN Models**: Implemented and evaluated CNN models based on AlexNet and ResNet18 architectures
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied various data augmentation techniques to enhance training performance and model generalization
- **Learning Rate Optimization**: Utilized cyclical learning rate scheduling to improve training efficiency
- **Visualization**: Integrated Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) for model interpretability

## Dataset

The project uses a comprehensive dataset of 10,000 images across 10 food categories:
- Apple pie
- Chicken wings
- Dumplings
- And 7 other popular food types

## Results

The implementation demonstrates effective food classification with improved performance through data augmentation and optimized training strategies. The Grad-CAM integration provides valuable insights into the model's decision-making process.

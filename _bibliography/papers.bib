  title={UltraDP: Generalizable Carotid Ultrasound Scanning with Force-Aware Diffusion Policy},
  author={Chen, Ruoqu and Yan, Xiangjie and Lv, Kangchen and Huang, Gao and Li, Zheng and Li, Xiang},
  abstract={Present UltraDP, a Diffusion-Policy-based method that receives multi-sensory inputs (ultrasound images, wrist camera image, contact wrench, and probe pose) and generates actions that are fit for multi-modal action distributions in autonomous ultrasound scanning. UltraDP achieves a 95% success rate in transverse scanning on previously unseen subjects, demonstrating its effectiveness.},

  title={Whole-Body Model Predictive Control for Mobile Manipulation with Task Priority Transition},
  author={Wang, Yushi and Chen, Ruoqu and Zhao, Mingguo},
  abstract={Developed a Whole-Body Model Predictive Control (WBMPC) framework to manage task priorities and scheduling in multi-task mobile manipulation scenarios. Integrated task priorities into a unified weight matrix, enabling smooth transitions across tasks in both spatial and temporal dimensions.},

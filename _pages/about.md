I am a senior undergraduate student in Department of Automation at Tsinghua University. My research interests lie in robotics manipulation, human-robot interaction, and the intersection of control theory and machine learning. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Xiang Li and Prof. Mingguo Zhao during my undergraduate studies, and I joined the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL) as a summer research intern in 2025. In the future, I will pursue my Ph.D. at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Mengdi Xu](https://www.mengdixu.me/).
